# Create a class called Student.
# The __init__ method should take name and grades (a list of numbers).
# Add a method called get_average() that returns the average of the student's grades.
# Add a method called has_passed() that returns True if the average is 50 or higher, and False otherwise.
# Test: Create a student named "John" with grades [40, 60, 50] and print if he passed.
